Sadly I did not manage to finish the task in the time limit.
The code is almost done, but It does has an issue in the parsing function.

Given a little bit more time I would have done the following:

1)Fix the parsing function and make sure that the tests pass.
2)break down the parse function to manageable parts either give it its own file or add its logic to the Operators objects.
3)break down the operators file to multiple files, one per class.
4)refactor the entire code to be more readable.
